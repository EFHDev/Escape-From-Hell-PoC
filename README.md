# Lore shit

"In 2016, the Norvinsk region was established by our government, in a joint effort with the Finniskis, to construct a new pipeline. However, what followed was an unimaginable nightmare. Merely two years after the pipeline's completion, it was revealed that Terra Group had been engaged in massive illegal activities, operating under the guise of official contracts. Our once peaceful 'home' was thrown into chaos as it became a battleground between two powerful private military companies, Bear and USEC, leaving us civilians to fend for ourselves. We banded together to fight against these factions and survive, but every day, we hear of another group falling. Despite the odds, we hold onto hope that one day we'll all be able to Escape From Tarkov.

Escape from Hell takes place just months after the collapse of the Norvinsk region goverment, and puts you in the shoes of a civilian. You are faced with limited resources, connections, and provisions, and most importantly, the struggle to maintain your humanity in a brutal world. Can you endure the hardships and ultimately escape from Tarkov?"
