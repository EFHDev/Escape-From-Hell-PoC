# Lore shit

"In 2016, our goverment made the norvinsk region. It was a great feat, a whole new pipe line in coordnation with the finniskis, But then hell let loose. Only 2 years after the pipeline was finished, Terra group was uncovered to be doing massive amounts of illegal activitys under offical contracts. It sent our little "home" into dismay, becoming a warzone between two PMC groups. Bear, and USEC. While we, the civilians were left to fend for ourselves. We formed groups to fight back both of these groups just to survive. But everyday you hear about another group falling... But one day.. We will all Escape from Tarkov..."

Escape from Hell is set mere months after the collapse of the Norvinsk region. You play as a Civilian. Limited money, connections, provisons, and worst of all, humanity. Will you survive and Escape from Tarkov?
