I tried to use his client mod to learn how to detect damage, and add a temp buff, and then debuffs, basiclly his Adrenaline mod, but with debuffs of getting shot, 
also tried to use it to do my medical debuff system, but that fell flat :kekw: 

Eventually both these systems will probally make their way into EFH, and he will be to thank for them for his source on Adrenaline, showing me how the fuck damage 
detection works

He makes awesome mods, he's a funny guy, and in my world, uncanonicly he likes belgium sasuages.
