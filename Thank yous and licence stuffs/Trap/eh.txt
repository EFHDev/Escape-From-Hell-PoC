ima keep it real i have no clue what thing of trap i used to have to put the licence in here, but its there for a reason so just in case

Trap makes some cool ass shit! His path to tarkov, and progressive stash were a must have when i played SPT-AKI, hes cool as fuck

What i used: No fucking clue, if anyone finds his code in here lmk becaue i genuinlly have NO IDEA. Ill throw a crisp fiver your way if you find it lol
